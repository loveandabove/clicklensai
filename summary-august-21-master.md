### Phase 2: OpenAI Integration
- OpenAI Vision API implementation with gpt-4o-mini model
- Single-step photo analysis replacing multi-step approach
- Prompt engineering for ingredient-specific recipe generation
- JSON response structure enforcement

### Phase 3: Deployment Pipeline
- GitHub to Netlify auto-deploy integration
- Environment variable configuration (`OPENAI_API_KEY`)
- ES module compatibility resolution
- Production debugging implementation

### Phase 4: Production Optimization
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- API authentication troubleshooting
- Environment variable validation
- Function monitoring and debugging tools

## üîß Development Workflow

### Local Development
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/loveandabove/clicklensai.git
cd clicklensai
npm install

# Environment setup
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here" > .env

# Start development server
netlify dev
# Access at http://localhost:8888
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Automatic deployment
git add .
git commit -m "Feature description"
git push origin main
# Netlify auto-deploys within 1-2 minutes
```

### Environment Configuration
**Netlify Dashboard** ‚Üí **Site Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**:
- **Key**: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- **Value**: `sk-proj-[your-openai-api-key]`
- **Scope**: "Same value" for all deployment contexts

## üêõ Critical Troubleshooting Guide

### Most Common Issues

1. **"Build your first function" Display**
   - **Cause**: Functions not detected or compilation failed
   - **Solution**: Verify ES module syntax and netlify.toml configuration

2. **API Authentication Errors (401)**
   - **Cause**: Environment variable misconfiguration
   - **Solution**: Delete and recreate OPENAI_API_KEY in Netlify dashboard

3. **Function Deployment Failures**
   - **Cause**: Module system conflicts between parent/child package.json
   - **Solution**: Ensure consistent ES module usage across project

### Debugging Workflow
1. **Check Deploy Status**: Netlify Dashboard ‚Üí Deploys ‚Üí "Published" status
2. **Verify Function**: Functions dashboard shows "1 Lambda function actively running"
3. **Access Logs**: Logs ‚Üí Functions ‚Üí recipe ‚Üí Real-time debugging output
4. **Environment Validation**: Debug logs show API key presence and format

### Debug Log Interpretation
```
API Key exists: true        ‚úÖ Environment variable loaded
API Key value: sk-proj-...  ‚úÖ Key format correct
Image received: true        ‚úÖ Frontend communication working
```
